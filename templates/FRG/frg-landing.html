          <h2>Scientific Goals</h2>
          <p>
            Some of the most difficult challenges in all of mathematics, such as the Riemann Hypothesis and the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture, are naturally phrased in terms of L-functions. These functions encode information such as how many primes there are up to a given magnitude, or the frequency of rational number solutions to certain equations, or the distribution of special points on a surface, all of which are important in number theory. L-functions are often studied in collections called families.
          </p>
          <p>
            In recent years, researchers have found very precise conjectures about the statistics of values and zeros of the Riemann zeta function and other families of L-functions. The &ldquo;recipe&rdquo; of Conrey, Farmer, Keating, Rubinstein and Snaith, and the multiple Dirichlet series approach of Diaconu, Hoffstein and Goldfeld, both in the late 90's and early 2000's, opened the door to a deeper understanding of moments in families of L-functions. Since then there have been hundreds of papers about moments of L-functions. The deeper but analogous &ldquo;ratios&rdquo; conjectures of Conrey, Farmer and Zirnbauer have had a corresponding effect on studies of zeros of L-functions in families. Motivated by work of Bogomolny and Keating, seven papers by Conrey and Keating have elaborated an arithmetic approach to understanding these conjectures in the case of the Riemann zeta-function by understanding explicit estimates for (generalized) divisor correlations. The main aim of this FRG grant was to understand this mechanism in the case of other families of L-functions.
          </p>
          <p>
            The basic goal of the FRG was to better understand, from a number theoretic perspective, the recipe for moments of families of L-functions, and possibly implement that understanding to make some inroads into actually proving the moments. Another goal was to link the underlying mechanism to Manin's conjectures about point counting on complicated varieties. A third goal was to understand exponential sums that govern such computations. And finally, to establish a rigorous random matrix theory analogue of the methods.
          </p>
          <p>
            As the project progressed some new themes emerged. One was the ubiquitous appearance of Painlevé equations in the statistics of L-functions and charactersitic polynomials. Another was the central importance of \(\gamma_k(c)\) which is an indicator function of the changing shape of the main term in shifted divisor problems. Finally, there was the ever-increasing value of recognizing the structure of what we were doing in random matrix theory. An intrinsic difficulty in the latter is that it was unclear what the analogue of &ldquo;twisting&rdquo; by a Dirichlet polynomial was in the setting of random matrix theory.
          </p>
          <h2>Broader Impact</h2>
          <p>
            The FRG was partially successful on a number of its scientific goals. Going beyond that, one of the most important outcomes of the FRG project was the creation of the FRG Sococo community with close to 50 members. Regular weekly meetings, seminars, problem groups and social hours were held during the COVID pandemic. This community provided a blueprint for what is now the <a href="https://aimath.org/programs/researchcommunities/"
    target
    ldquo

    rdquo>AIM Research Communities</a> program.
          </p>
          <p>
            When the threat of COVID had largely subsided many of the group met in person for a month long program at AIM. Two particular focus topics of this meeting were Painlevé equations and the \(\gamma_k(c)\) function.
          </p>
          <p>
            Two Zoom seminars were run under the ambit of the FRG. The first was the FRG research seminar (organized by Brian Conrey) from 2020 to 2021 and second was the FRG graduate seminar (organized by Anurag Sahay) from 2021 to 2024.
