    <p>
        AIM hosts focused workshops in all areas of the mathematical sciences.
        AIM workshops are distinguished by their emphasis on a specific mathematical goal,
        such as making progress on a significant unsolved problem, understanding the proof
        of an important new result, or examining the convergence of two distinct areas of mathematics.

<p>
    AIM's process for supporting collaboration has been honed over many years and has
    evolved into a distinct "AIM-style of workshop." If you will be attending or proposing
    to organize an AIM workshop, we encourage to read about what to expect here.
</p>
<p>
    All AIM workshops have an open application process. Upcoming workshops marked with
    an asterisk (*) are still accepting applications. Successful applicants will communicate
    the alignment of their research interests with the topics in the workshop and their
    readiness to enter into collaborative research projects.
